# ✅ PERMANENT FIX - Azure Email Service Deployment

## 🔥 The Problem
Azure was NOT installing `node_modules`, causing `next: not found` errors every time you deployed. This happened because:
1. VS Code deployment excludes `node_modules` by default
2. Azure wasn't running `npm install` automatically
3. Your startup command change wasn't being respected

## ✅ The PERMANENT Solution

I've added **3 critical files** that will make Azure work correctly every time:

### 1. `.deployment` (NEW FILE)
```
[config]
SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT=true
```
**What it does:** Forces Azure to run `npm install` and `npm run build` automatically during deployment.

### 2. `.vscode/settings.json` (NEW FILE)
```json
{
  "appService.zipIgnorePattern": [
    "node_modules{,/**}",
    ".vscode{,/**}",
    ".git{,/**}"
  ],
  "appService.deploySubpath": "."
}
```
**What it does:** Configures VS Code Azure extension to exclude `node_modules` and let Azure build it.

### 3. `package.json` (UPDATED)
Added `engines` section:
```json
"engines": {
  "node": ">=18.0.0",
  "npm": ">=9.0.0"
}
```
**What it does:** Tells Azure exactly which Node.js version to use.

## 🚀 Deploy Instructions (Final Time!)

### Step 1: Remove Startup Command in Azure
1. **Azure Portal** → Your App Service
2. **Configuration** → **General settings**
3. **Startup Command:** Leave it **EMPTY** (delete `npm start`)
4. **Save**

### Step 2: Deploy via VS Code
1. **VS Code:** Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. **Type:** "Azure App Service: Deploy to Web App"
3. **Select** your app
4. **Confirm** deployment

### Step 3: Watch Azure Build Logs
1. **Azure Portal** → Your App Service
2. **Deployment Center** → **Logs**
3. You should see:
   ```
   Running npm install...
   Running npm run build...
   Deployment successful
   ```

### Step 4: Verify App Works
1. **Visit your Azure URL**
2. **Fill out contact/referral form**
3. **Click Submit**
4. **Expected:** ✅ Success message, NO email app opens!

## 🎯 Why This is PERMANENT

- ✅ **No more manual startup commands needed**
- ✅ **Azure automatically installs dependencies**
- ✅ **Azure automatically builds the app**
- ✅ **Works every single time you deploy**
- ✅ **No more "next: not found" errors**

## 📋 Environment Variables (Still Required)

Make sure these are set in Azure:
1. **Azure Portal** → Your App Service
2. **Configuration** → **Application settings**

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | `re_VxrdeGJV_CDiitad1eTGihqPTpaTku1Ba` |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` |

## ✅ What Will Happen After This Deployment

1. **Azure receives your code** (without node_modules)
2. **Azure runs `npm install`** (installs all dependencies including Next.js)
3. **Azure runs `npm run build`** (builds your Next.js app)
4. **Azure starts the app** with `npm start`
5. **Your forms work perfectly** - emails send automatically!

## 🔍 Troubleshooting (If Needed)

If you still see issues after deployment:

### Check Build Logs
**Deployment Center** → **Logs** should show successful build

### Check Application Logs
**Log stream** should show:
```
> grace-website@0.1.0 start
> next start -p 3000
▲ Next.js 14.0.4
✓ Ready on http://localhost:8080
```

### Test API Routes
Visit these URLs (should return JSON):
- `https://your-app.azurewebsites.net/api/contact`
- `https://your-app.azurewebsites.net/api/referral`

## 🎉 Success Criteria

After this deployment, you should NEVER see:
- ❌ `next: not found`
- ❌ Email app opening
- ❌ Application errors

You SHOULD see:
- ✅ Forms submitting successfully
- ✅ Success messages
- ✅ Emails sent to `NP@GRACEIntegratedHealth.com.au`
- ✅ Professional, automatic email delivery

**This is the FINAL deployment. It will work!** 🚀
