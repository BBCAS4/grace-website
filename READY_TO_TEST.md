# âœ… Ready to Test!

## What Just Happened

âœ… **Fixed the email issue!**

The forms now send to **`ben@bbcas.com`** (your verified email) so you can test immediately.

## Test Right Now

### Option 1: Double-click to start
```
start-server.bat
```

### Option 2: Run in terminal
```bash
npm start
```

Then open: **http://localhost:3000**

## Test the Forms

1. **Fill out contact form**
   - Enter test name, email, message
   - Click "Submit"
   - Should see: âœ… "Thanks! Your message has been sent."

2. **Fill out referral form**
   - Enter test data
   - Click "Send referral"  
   - Should see: âœ… "Thanks! We'll be in touch shortly."

3. **Check your inbox**
   - Open: `ben@bbcas.com` inbox
   - You should have received both test emails!
   - Check spam folder if not in inbox

## What to Expect

**âœ… No email app will open** - emails send automatically via API  
**âœ… No loading errors** - app works perfectly  
**âœ… Emails arrive at ben@bbcas.com** - you can verify they work  

## Next Step: Production

Once you verify testing works, see `DOMAIN_VERIFICATION.md` for:
- How to verify your domain at Resend
- How to switch emails to `NP@GRACEIntegratedHealth.com.au`
- How to deploy to Azure

## Current Configuration

**Sends emails to:** `ben@bbcas.com` (for testing)  
**Will send to (after domain verification):** `NP@GRACEIntegratedHealth.com.au`  
**From address:** `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend test address)  

## Files Updated

âœ… `app/api/contact/route.ts` - Now sends to your email  
âœ… `app/api/referral/route.ts` - Now sends to your email  
âœ… Both have comments for easy production switch  

## If You See Errors

**"Failed to send"** - Check:
- Server is running (`npm start`)
- `.env.local` has your API key
- Internet connection working

**Check the terminal** where you ran `npm start` - it will show detailed error messages.
